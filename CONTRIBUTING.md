# Contributing Guides

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to Leoric!

There are many ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a bird's-eye overview of how you can get involved.

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem? Have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- üëç - upvote
- üëé - downvote

If no such issue were found, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Features Requests

Please include the following with each issue:

- Version of Leoric
- Version of your database
- Version of your node
- Your operating system
- Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue
- What was expected, versus what you actually get
- A code snippet that demonstractes the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can pull down to recreate the issue locally

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

- [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report isn't duplicated
- [ ] Describe the environment that runs leoric, database, Node.js, etc.
- [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!
